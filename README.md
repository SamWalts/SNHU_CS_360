    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    This app is designed as an inventory application.
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
    There were three screens required, with several toast screens added for various user interactions.
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
    My main technique was to incrementally build from my previous projects. The biggest part was working on the SQL for the SQLite database.
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
    I need to add unit tests and android tests to this.
    Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
    My biggest innovation was when I had to tie together the application screens after inputting a new item.
    In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
    My best component I think was the database. Providing safe insert and delete statements will help me much more in my career.
